# Cargo Man

Cargo Man is a relaxing 2D driving game. The Player's objective is to find and deliver the lost cargo to customers as Cargo Man! The packages are scattered accross locations but thankfully Cargo Man can use speed up items (boost) to travel without hassle.

This is the first 2D game I have ever done and I loved it. I learned new Unity techniques that are used in the 2D game development. The assets made it look refreshing. The game was easy to develop and at the same time rewarding. I think the delivery games will have always a place in the gaming industry as they are fun and satisfying.

Safe travels! :)
